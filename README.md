# MLPortfolio-ENG

Welcome to my project portfolio!

Here, you'll find a selection of my work, where I combine my passion for technology and data analysis to solve a variety of problems. The portfolio is divided into four projects, each focused on applying different machine learning techniques: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Q-learning, and Neural Network.

To deepen my understanding of these techniques, I personally designed the algorithms used in the Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Q-learning projects, allowing me to explore their inner workings in detail.

I invite you to explore each project and learn more about the process behind each developed solution.

Thank you for your time and for visiting my portfolio!
